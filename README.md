[Visiting Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6789) adds a cast of characters that would visit Pelican Town. The characters will not visit the valley right away. Instead they will start visiting as the player progresses in the game. There is spacing between arrivals of the characters to avoid event piles.
