[Visiting Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6789) adds a cast of characters that would visit Pelican Town. The characters will not visit the valley right away. Instead they will start visiting as the player progresses in the game. There is spacing between arrivals of the characters to avoid event piles.

He's a down-to-earth, hardworking man who is just trying to provide for his family. You can often spot him casting his line in the valley on Fridays and Saturdays.

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most other content pack mods. 

Potential issues are:
-  Weird standing spots, either with other NPCs or with objects in map. It can happen in daily schedule and in festival.
-  Event not playing properly due to changing map.
-  Lore differences. The characters may say something that could be not in line with other mods.

Patches made for other mods:
- Character schedules and heart event patches when [East Scarp](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787) and [Stardew Valley Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753) is installed
- Conversation topic dialogues for some [East Scarp](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787) and [Stardew Valley Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753) characters (meaning the modded character would take note of occurrences introduced by this mod). These are mostly characters that I've encountered when playing the game. Feel free to post your suggestion for other modded characters.
