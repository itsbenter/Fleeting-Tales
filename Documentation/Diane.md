## Relationships

Diane is married to Francesco, and even though they love each other and get along, they are unable to spend much of their time together. Diane knows wide range of people because of her background, but she thinks many of these connections are just mere surface-level. In Pelican Town, she mainly spends her time at the museum with Gunther and at other times watches over the children with Penny.

## Schedules
Diane visits Pelican Town on Monday and Tuesday.
