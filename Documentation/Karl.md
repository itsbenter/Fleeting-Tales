Karl is an office worker from Zuzu City. He comes to Pelican Town for some fishing, a hobby and a way to escape the bustling city life. He's a down-to-earth, hardworking man who is just trying to provide for his family. You can often spot him casting his line in the valley on Fridays and Saturdays.

## Relationships

Karl resides in Zuzu alongside his wife, Emma. From his dialogues it appears that Emma does not share his loves for fishing. He generally gets along well with his co-workers, but despite his friendly demeanor, Karl is not particularly close to anyone except for Linus and Willy in Pelican Town.
