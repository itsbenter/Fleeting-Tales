        //Introduction event: That Lady Arrived
        //Lewis 1: And here we are
        //Lewis 2: This here is the town's library and museum, all made possible by the taxes from our local businesses.#$b#It's taken a lot of hard work, but, as you'll soon notice, the collection here has become something quite special.
        //Diane 1: That's wonderful to hear. News reached me that Pelican Town's museum collection has rapidly grow. $1
        //Lewis 3: Hehe... Of course, all due to the town's excellent management
        //Lewis 4: Ah, speaking of!
        //Lewis 5: Diane, let me introduce you to @.#$b#A recent addition to our town, now managing the land right next to the Bus Station.
        //Diane 2: It's quite nice meeting you @. Name is Diane.#$b#You caught me in the middle of a little tour of this charming town you have here.#$b#I take it you visit this place often?
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 1 Player 1: Yes, I like it here.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 2 Player 2: Not really. I’m too busy.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Player 3: Only when I need to.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 1 Diane 3: Oh, isn't that nice.#$b#I'd love to discuss all the different books and artifacts with you.#$b#Well, at your convenience, surely.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 2 Diane 4: Understandable. I figure that might be the case.#$b#I guess I'd have to look for someone who would be more intimate with what the place have in store then.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 2 Lewis 6: We have Gunther, the curator. He should get you covered Diane.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Diane 5: Interesting, what is it that you need to do here?
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Lewis 7: Oh, sometimes @ donates items for the collection.
        //QuickQuestion 1 Response 3 Diane 6: That's most fascinating. So @ must be quite knowledgable of the area then...
        //Lewis 8: Shall we continue to the inside?
        //Diane 9: Surely, if you don't mind.
        //Diane 10: Once again, it's a pleasure meeting you @.
        //Lewis 9 *ehem* I expect you to be on your best behavior with Diane.#$b#She planned for this tour for quite some time. This must be important to her.#$b#Everyone will need to mind their manners!
        //
        //Lewis will say that Diane is planning to visit the town again
        //Marnie would be a little jealous
        //Sam would mention he saw Diane
        //Gus mention she seems like a kind lady, but wonder what gets her to the town
        //Caroline mention Pierre noticing the jewelry "There's a woman who visit with Lewis. Seems nice. Yet, all Pierre can do it commenting about her accesories.#$b#Sometimes I just can't with him."
        //Clint seems blushed infatuated
        //Emily says that Diane is witholding something "That lady's aura is quite cloudy, like it's waiting for the sun to shine through."
        //Vincent and Leah says he didn't get to see Diane
        //Shane says So someone arranged a tour for this town. Bah, why do I care?"
        //
        //Rosa would say "So I heard there's someone who toured the town with Lewis. Of course he didn't bother to take her to this far away land $2"
        //Juliet would mention that Diane seems from money
